Project log: 
Purpose of this repo:  Evaluating if I can use this API for my CLI project

3/31/19:
Copied repo from gitcoop at site of owner dcentral1se 
Emailed decentral1se; notify him about API use and ask questions
Looks like need to run Docker to activate API as a service. Not sure I want to do this for the CLI project.
